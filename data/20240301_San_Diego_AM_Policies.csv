Mitigation,"This measure obligates IOUs, Publicly owned utilities (POUs), ESPs, and CCAs
to procure 60 percent of retail sales per year from eligible renewable sources by 2030 and 100
percent carbon-free source"
Mitigation,"Requires that building shells and components be designed to conserve
energy and water. Mandatory and voluntary measures became effective on January 1, 2020, and the
standards and guidelines are updated every 3 years, the next being in 2022. Local governments are
responsible for adoption and enforcement of the standards. Note that reductions due to a local
“reach” energy-efficiency ordinance and voluntary energy efficiency are accounted in local measures
separately from the accounting for this State regulation."
Mitigation,"AB 1470 created a 10-year incentive program funded at $25 million per year to encourage the installation of 200,000 solar water heating systems that offset natural gas use in homes and businesses throughout the State. AB 797 extended the operation of the program through July 31, 2020, reserving 50 percent of the total program budget for the installation of solar thermal systems in low-income residential housing or buildings in disadvantaged communities and expanding the program to homeowners that lack access to natural gas, among other things. The California Solar Initiative – Thermal Program began phasing out on July 31, 2020, and is no longer accepting incentive applications. Hence, a local strategy has been added to promote installation of solar hot water heaters. Local GHG reductions may be credited to the City as solar water heaters are installed around town."
Mitigation,"The CPUC administers a Qualifying Facilities and QF/CHP Program. Qualifying facilities are those that meet certain size and efficiency criteria. CHP, also known as cogeneration, produces both electricity and thermal energy onsite, replacing or supplementing electricity provided from a local utility and fuel burned in an onsite boiler or furnace. CHP systems increase energy security by producing energy at the point of use and significantly improve energy Emission Reduction Strategies City of Coronado Climate Action Plan Final 4-4 March 2022 efficiency. The program requires that California’s three largest IOUs (i.e., PG&E, SDG&E, and SCE) collectively procure 3,000 MW of capacity from CHP facilities by 2018."
Mitigation,SB 350 requires the State to double statewide energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas end uses by 2030.
Mitigation,"Landfill gas is a natural byproduct of decomposing organic material in landfills and composed of approximately 50 percent methane. Rather than being released into the atmosphere and further contributing to global warming, landfill gases can be captured, converted, and used as a renewable energy source. This process is commonly referred to as methane capture and achieved through a series of wells and blower/flare or vacuum systems that collect the gas where it can be processed and treated (EPA 2021b). The Landfill Methane Rule requires gas collection and control systems on landfills with more than 450,000 tons of waste-in-place. The rule requires a 40 percent reduction in landfill methane emission by 2030 from a 2013 baseline. The rule also requires the installation of methane capture technology and associated monitoring systems on all landfills without methane capture with a goal of increasing the facility level methane capture rate to the highest extent feasible (i.e., approaching 100 percent) The measure also establishes statewide performance standards to maximize methane capture efficiencies."
Mitigation,"AB 1493 (Pavley I) was adopted in 2002 and required CARB to adopt vehicle standards that started lowering GHG emissions from new light-duty autos, beginning with model year 2009. California has adopted additional strengthening of the Pavley standards (Pavley II or Advanced Clean Cars measure) for vehicle model years 2017–2025. Together, the two standards are expected to increase average fuel economy through 2025 and reduce GHG emissions from the California transportation sector."
Mitigation,"This measure accounts for the emission reductions from increasing the
number of EV charging stations and the resulting increase in the percentage of total VMT driven by
EVs.
Hybrid EVs, alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), and
all-electric EVs produce lower emissions than
conventional vehicles. All EV types emit at least
40 percent fewer GHG emissions than
conventional vehicles (reductions depend on
electricity-generation profiles), and AFVs can
reduce emissions by more than 30 percent.
However, conventional gasoline and diesel
vehicles still comprise roughly 90 percent of
Coronado’s vehicles as of 2019, so programs and
infrastructure are needed to encourage the use of
EV or hybrid vehicle ownership are greatly
needed.
The primary infrastructure required to facilitate and promote the use of EVs in the City and the
region are EV charging stations. Coronado has already installed 14 EV charging stations throughout
the City, including at City Hall, the Public Services building, the Coronado Municipal Golf Course, and
the Coronado Cays.
To expand on these installations, the City could:
 Encourage new development to install a greater number of charging stations than what is
required by the Title 24 standards.
Emission Reduction Strategies
City of Coronado Climate Action Plan
Final 4-7 March 2022
 Install additional public charging stations.
Increasing the number of EV charging stations would increase the percentage of VMT by electric and
alternative fuel vehicles by raising the number of EVs and AFVs owned and operated in the City.
Increasing the percentage of VMT by EVs and AFVs would reduce transportation-related GHG
emissions and improve air quality for the City’s residents.
Prior to installing additional charging stations, the City may consider conducting a needs assessment
for EV infrastructure in the City to better serve EV transportation demand. This needs assessment
would determine the optimal number of charging stations and where they should be located to best
serve the City. SANDAG recently stated in its EV Needs Assessment that it is looking to add 140,000
charging stations in the San Diego region by 2030, where there are currently 6,700 chargers. The
City can also work with SANDAG to leverage the work they have already performed in determining
the number and location of charging stations to maximize the number of charging stations the City
can install at public locations."
Mitigation,"With this measure, the City would help establish an electric carshare
program. Carsharing offers people convenient access to a vehicle for personal or commuting
purposes. One-way carshare (i.e., free-floating) providers allow members to pick up the vehicle in
one place and end their trip in another location. Carsharing helps encourage transportation
alternatives by reducing vehicle ownership, thereby reducing VMT and associated GHG emissions."
Mitigation,"This measure would
involve implementation of a neighborhood
electric vehicle (NEV) Transportation Program.
NEVs are classified in the California Vehicle Code
as low speed vehicles. NEVs offer an alternative to
traditional vehicle trips and can be used legally
on roadways with speed limits of 35 miles per
hour or less. They are ideal for short trips
around town. The measure accounts for the net
emission reduction from (1) the avoided
emissions from conventional passenger vehicle
trips displaced by electric NEVs; and (2) the
added indirect emissions from electricity for NEV charging."
Mitigation,"This measure would include more-frequent transit service on MTS Route 904. Headway improvements increase transit ridership by reducing travel times, which improves the user experience and increases the attractiveness of transit service. The mode shift from passenger vehicles to transit that this measure causes would reduce vehicle trips and, therefore, VMT and associated GHG emissions."
Mitigation,"This measure would include free transit service throughout the year on MTS Route 904. Transit pricing strategies, including subsidies, are designed to reduce the costs associated with using transit, thereby creating incentives for people to shift from other, more emissive traveling modes, thereby reducing GHG emissions. In the future, the City may pursue a subsidized fare free shuttle service during peak ridership periods, such as during the weekend."
Mitigation,"This measure would include electrification of the buses on MTS Route 904. Electrification would replace the direct GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion with less-emissive indirect emissions from electricity used to charge the busses, resulting in a net GHG reduction."
Mitigation,"This measure would include implementation of a microtransit EV shuttle service. Microtransit services utilize real-time ride-hailing, mobile tracking, and app-based payment to provide demand-based service to users. Microtransit services are flexible and can be designed to fulfill the mobility needs of a community. The intent is to promote mobility options by filling existing transportation gaps around town (e.g., first-mile/last-mile trips, service to and from the Cays). The program goal would not be replacing existing transportation mobility options, such as the Coronado Cab Company and public transit, but reducing the use of single-occupancy passenger vehicles and improving4-12 4-12 access to and promoting the use of microtransit shuttles, while also offering other mobility options for local residents, commuters, and visitors around town. Microtransit can help to facilitate connections to and from transit stops and provide users with an alternative to driving for short trips, thereby reducing VMT and associated GHG emissions. Microtransit services are typically subsidized by a range of funding sources and may be fare-free or cost a nominal fee. A needs assessment should be conducted to identify program goals and objectives, revenues, and costs and include implementation strategies that would enhance mobility in Coronado and prevent unintended consequences, such as disruptions to existing transportation services. A private company typically runs the service app, marketing, and advertising. The Free Ride San Diego (FRED) example in the City of San Diego is one of many. Other electric shuttle program options are available throughout the nation, and the technology continues to evolve. Such programs may be app-based, fixed-route, on-demand, or a hybrid model that follow a range of business models. App-based systems may also be created to support existing mobility options, while not necessarily subsidizing additional service. A goal of the program would be supplementing existing transportation options and not competing against such options."
Mitigation,"The City currently subsidizes ferry service for pedestrians and bicyclists between the Ferry Landing and the Broadway Pier or the Convention Center in San Diego. Monday through Friday, during the morning commute hours, the City provides complimentary service to commuters, including a free afternoon return trip. This reduction measure accounts for two different sources of reduced GHG emissions associated with this service: The 2019 expansion of the ferry service to add an additional sixth morning ferry into Coronado, increasing the number of ferry users, thus offsetting passenger on-road vehicle emissions; Future replacement of the current diesel ferry with full a battery-electric model to eliminate all direct emissions during operation"
Mitigation,"This measure accounts for the reduction in vehicle trips, and therefore VMT and GHG emissions, that would be achieved with expansion of the City’s bikeway network, as called for by the 2018 ATP. A bikeway network includes an interconnected system of bike lanes, bike paths, and cycle tracks (i.e., Class I, Class II, and Class IV facilities). Bike facilities may share the roadway with vehicles or provide a dedicated pathway that separates bikes from cars or pedestrians. Increasing the network of bike facilities help to encourage biking as a safe and convenient alternative to driving."
Mitigation,"This measure would include expansion of the City’s sidewalks and walkways. Construction of sidewalk would help to encourage walking and reduce vehicle trips, thereby reducing VMT and GHG emissions. The City’s 2018 ATP identified roadways that scored low on the Pedestrian Environment Quality Evaluation. These roadways are prime candidates for improved pedestrian infrastructure."
Mitigation,"This measure assumes that there would be an increase the number of zero-emission municipal vehicles. As vehicle fleet turns over, vehicles would be replaced with new ZEVs. Electric fleet vehicles replace gasoline- fueled vehicles, resulting in a direct GHG-emission reduction from fossil fuels."
Mitigation,"Establish goals for solar installations on new and existing residential and nonresidential (i.e., commercial and industrial) locations. These goals would be developed for the 2030 and 2045 timeframe.  2030 Residential Goal: 4-MW installed capacity, equivalent to the annual average electricity use of approximately 1.6 households"
Mitigation,"2045 Residential Goal: 5-MW installed capacity, equivalent to the annual electricity use of approximately 1.3 households"
Mitigation,2030 Nonresidential Goal: 5-MW installed capacity
Mitigation,2045 Nonresidential Goal: 6-MW installed capacity
Mitigation,"This measure would promote the installation of solar water heating systems in both new and existing households, going beyond the goals of the State solar water heaters measure (AB 1470 and AB 797), setting a goal for a proportion of households with an installed solar water heating system in 2030 and 2045. Potential goals with the proportion of households and the additional solar water heating systems needed to be installed beyond the State measure could include: 2030 Existing Housing Goal: 6.5 percent of existing housing with an installed solar water heating system (453 additional solar water heating systems) ;"
Mitigation,2045 Existing Housing Goal: 13 percent of new housing with an installed solar water heating system (18 additional solar water heating systems)
Mitigation,2030 New Housing Goal: 10.5 percent of existing housing with an installed solar water heating system (753 additional solar water heating systems)
Mitigation,2045 New Housing Goal: 18 percent of new housing with an installed solar water heating system (41 additional solar water heating systems)
Mitigation,"Adopt outdoor lighting standards for all outdoor public lighting to reduce electricity consumption. The measure includes public streetlights, pedestrian pathway lights, area lighting for parks and public parking lots, and outdoor lighting around public buildings. It also includes the installation of more-effective lamps that would use less electricity while producing the same or greater amount of light."
Mitigation,"The City could implement programs to increase the renewable energy portfolio for electricity supplies for the City beyond that mandated by the State per existing law (e.g., SB 100). An option could be joining an existing CCA program, also known as municipal aggregation, in which a collection of local governments establishes a joint powers authority to procure power on behalf of local accounts from an alternative supplier, while still receiving transmission and distribution service from their existing utility provider. AB 117 (2002) enables California cities and counties, either individually or collectively, to supply electricity to customers within their jurisdiction by establishing a CCA program. Smaller cities like Coronado typically collaborate with other cities to form a CCA, which usually operates on a nonprofit model. The City of San Diego joined with the Cities of Chula Vista, Encinitas, Imperial Beach, and La Mesa to form San Diego Community Power, a joint powers authority. The Cities of Carlsbad, Del Mar, and Solana Beach formed the Clean Energy Alliance CCA. With community choice energy programs continuing to gain prominence, regional utilities like SDG&E are looking to transition out of the electricity procurement business entirely and effectively become a poles and wires company. It remains to be seen what the mid- to long-term impacts would be if that were to take place. Quantification of this measure presumes that the City would achieve results better than those that would occur with SB100 by achieving 100 percent renewable energy citywide by 2035, potentially through a CCA that increases the renewable energy supply in the City. This strategy is considered optional and is not counted toward the City’s 2030 emissions-reduction target. Preliminary analysis indicates that if the City successfully implemented the CCA strategy, it would achieve approximately 78 percent renewable energy by 2030, and an additional 9,871 MTCO2e (in addition to the State’s RPS) could be reduced."
Mitigation,"This measure would help to transition from potable water use for application where recycled water would be sufficient. The City is proposing the construction and operation of a new recycled water supply at the Coronado Municipal Golf Course. The facility would have capacity to treat up to 1 million gallons per day. Recycled water the facility produces would be used to irrigate the golf course and other public landscape in the City (e.g., City parks, Orange Avenue medians), replacing its current use of potable water. Increased usage of recycled water would reduce the electricity consumed by water and wastewater treatment and conveyance, thereby reducing GHG emissions."
Mitigation,"This measure would include exceeding the waste diversion goal (75 percent) required by AB 341 by adopting citywide waste goals to divert all organic waste by 2045. The City would have responsibility to expand or establish composting, recycling, and yard waste programs to residences and businesses. The City would work with waste providers to ensure the goal of 100- percent reduction of organic waste would be achievable by 2045. This measure could include: Expand educational programs to inform residents about reuse, recycling, composting, waste-to- energy, and zero-waste programs. Encourage local recycling and composting initiatives at the neighborhood level."
Mitigation,Adopt a construction and demolition waste-recovery ordinance that meets or exceeds the CALGreen voluntary guidance of a 65–75 percent reduction in nonhazardous construction and demolition waste.
Mitigation,Encourage local businesses to expand their recycling and composting efforts and reduce packaging of products manufactured in the City.
Mitigation,"Establish a reuse/recycling center where furniture, appliances, building materials, and other useful, nonhazardous items may be dropped off or purchased for a nominal fee."
